“In this video, we’ll see how to create a Pull Request from a feature branch to the develop branch in Azure DevOps.”

“Before raising the PR, make sure your commits are clean and make any required updates to the azure_pipeline.yml file.”

“Next, go to Repos → Pull Requests → New Pull Request. Select your feature branch as the source, develop as the target, add a clear title and description, and assign reviewers.”

“Once the PR is created, Azure DevOps automatically runs validation checks — including the CI build defined through azure_pipeline.yml, code quality checks, security scans, and work-item linking.”

“A mandatory App Dev Lead reviewer must approve the PR. Only after all checks pass and reviews are completed can the PR be merged.”

“Finally, click Set Auto-Complete or Complete to merge the feature branch into develop.”

“All protected branches follow this PR process, ensuring code quality, traceability, and compliance with GitFlow standards.”


📌 Learning Overview (Intro Slide)

In this module, you will learn:

✔️ How to create a Pull Request from a feature branch to the develop branch

✔️ What to check before raising a PR (clean commits & pipeline updates)

✔️ How to fill PR details and assign reviewers in Azure DevOps

✔️ How PR validation works (CI build, security, quality checks, work-item linking)

✔️ How approvals work for protected branches

✔️ How to complete and merge a PR following GitFlow standards

📌 Summary (Ending Slide)

We completed the PR workflow by:

✔️ Preparing clean commits and updating the pipeline file

✔️ Creating a PR from feature → develop

✔️ Running automated validations in Azure DevOps

✔️ Getting mandatory App Dev Lead approval

✔️ Completing the PR and merging the changes

✔️ Following protected-branch policies and GitFlow process


“Welcome to this lesson. In this video, we’ll learn how to pull the latest code from a remote repository into our local machine.”

“Before we begin, make sure you are inside your project folder using the terminal.”

“First, check which branch you are currently on by running:
git status
This helps confirm that you are working in the correct branch before pulling updates.”

“Next, we fetch the latest changes from the remote repository using:
git fetch
Fetch does not modify your code. It only downloads the latest updates so you can review them.”

“Now, to bring those changes into your working branch, use:
git pull
This command fetches and merges the latest updates from the remote branch into your local branch.”

“If your local files and remote files don’t have conflicts, Git will automatically merge the changes and update your working directory.”

“Once the pull is complete, you can verify the updated files using git log or by checking the modified files directly in your editor.”

“And that’s it! You have successfully pulled the latest code from the remote repository and synced your local branch.”
