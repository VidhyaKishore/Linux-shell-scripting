“Welcome to this module.
In this video, we’ll learn how to pull the latest code from a remote branch into your local machine.

Before starting, make sure you are inside your project folder.
Now, open your terminal and verify your current branch by running git branch.
If you need to switch to the branch you want to update, use git checkout branch-name.

Once you are on the correct branch, run the command git pull.
This pulls the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

If your local branch is tracking a specific remote branch, Git will automatically pull from that branch.
Otherwise, you can pull explicitly using git pull origin branch-name.

After the pull completes, your local workspace will have the latest code, ensuring you're fully up to date before continuing your development work.

That’s it — you’ve successfully fetched and merged the latest updates from your remote branch.”
