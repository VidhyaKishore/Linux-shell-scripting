🔐 1. Vault
Definition: The central service for managing secrets.

In HCV: Vault is the core application that provides the interface and engine for storing, accessing, and managing sensitive data securely.

🔑 2. Secrets
Definition: Sensitive data managed by Vault.

In HCV: These can be credentials, API keys, tokens, certificates, or even dynamic secrets like short-lived AWS credentials or database logins. Vault stores and manages these securely.

🛡 3. Policies
Definition: Rules that define who can access what in Vault.

In HCV: Policies control access by mapping users or machines to specific permissions (e.g., read/write access to a secret path). They help implement least privilege access.

🔐 4. Auth Methods
Definition: Ways to authenticate to Vault.

In HCV: Vault supports multiple auth methods such as:

AppRole (used in automation)

LDAP, GitHub, Okta (for human users)

Kubernetes, AWS IAM, etc.
These determine who you are before allowing access.

⚙️ 5. Secret Engines
Definition: Plugins for storing or generating secrets.

In HCV: Each secret engine handles a specific type of secret, such as:

kv for static key-value storage

database for dynamic DB credentials

aws for generating temporary AWS keys

transit for encryption-as-a-service

🧩 Summary
In HashiCorp Vault, these five core concepts work together to provide a secure, flexible, and scalable secrets management system. Understanding these building blocks helps in securely managing secrets across various systems and environments.
