            if [[ "$file" == "$EMPTY_DIR/"* || "$file" == "$NON_EMPTY_DIR/"* ]]; then

“This condition checks whether the file belongs to either the empty directory or the non-empty directory.”

How the Check Works

$file contains the full path of a file
$EMPTY_DIR/ is the starting path of the first directory
* means anything inside that directory
== checks whether the file path starts with that directory
|| means OR

It checks location, not file content

* means any file inside
|| means either one is enough
[[ ]] is used for safe string matching

✅ Final Decision Rule
Condition	Result
File is in EMPTY_DIR	TRUE
File is in NON_EMPTY_DIR	TRUE
File is in neither	FALSE

If the result is TRUE, the code inside then runs.
