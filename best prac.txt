Best Practices in Shell Scripting
✅ Use Meaningful Variable Names – Improves readability and maintainability.
✅ Always Use Shebang (#!/bin/bash) – Ensures the script runs in the correct shell.
✅ Add Comments (#) – Document your code for better understanding.
✅ Use Quoting ("$var") – Prevents issues with spaces and special characters.
✅ Check for Errors (set -e & || exit 1) – Stops execution on errors.
✅ Validate User Input – Avoids unexpected failures.
✅ Use Functions – Modularizes code for reusability.
✅ Avoid Hardcoded Paths – Use variables or configuration files.
✅ Optimize with sed & awk – Efficient text processing.
✅ Schedule Tasks (cron or systemd) – Automate repetitive tasks.
