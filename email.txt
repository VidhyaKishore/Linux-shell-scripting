Hi, 

You’re receiving this invite delay because there is a small error that happened in saba. As per the process the registration and approval window closes 7 days before the session and we will roll out the invite. In saba the non-approved participants will be automatically dropped but this didn’t happen in our case. Some of you reached out to me for the session invite. Kindly check the trail mail for the same and also be ready with the prerequisite.
