Creating a Pull Request (PR)
1.	Before Creating PR:
o	Ensure your commits are "neat" by rebasing if necessary
o	Make necessary changes to the azure_pipeline.yml file for your project
2.	Create the PR:
o	Go to the "Repos" section in ADO
o	Select "Pull Requests" and click "New Pull Request"
o	Fill in the required fields:
	Source branch (your feature branch)
	Target branch (usually develop or release branch)
	Title and description
	Add reviewers
o	Click "Create"
3.	PR Validation Checks:
o	The PR will trigger an automatic build process using the azure_pipeline.yml file
o	Code must pass security checks, code leak detection, code quality checks, etc.
o	PR must have a linked work item
o	PR must have a successful CI build
4.	Review and Approval:
o	Mandatory App Dev Lead (ADO-appID-Engineer-review) review and approval is required
o	Peer review is performed by the App Dev Lead
5.	Complete the PR:
o	Once approved, click "Set auto-complete" and "Complete"
o	Your changes will be merged into the target branch
Important Policies
•	Direct commits to protected branches are not allowed
•	All changes to protected branches must go through the PR process
•	PRs require linked work items
•	PRs require successful build validation
•	PRs require mandatory reviewer approval (maker-checker policy)
This branching strategy follows the GitFlow model, ensuring code quality and proper version control throughout the development lifecycle.
