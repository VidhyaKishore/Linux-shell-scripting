What Happens with Auto-Rotating Secrets?
The latest secret (e.g., database password or API key) is automatically rotated (changed) on a schedule.

When the first instance of the payments app starts, it pulls the latest secret.

Other instances that start during the same rotation window use the same secret.

So, multiple instances share the same secret version for that time period.

ðŸ”¹ Why Is This Useful?
Reduces the number of secret requests (low latency).

All instances stay in sync with the same valid credentials.

If something fails during rotation (e.g., external provider down), existing secrets still work, so no app crashes.
