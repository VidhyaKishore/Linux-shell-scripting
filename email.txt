Branches in Git allow us to work on new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

git branch

ADO Branching Policies in SCB
Branch Types
Protected Branches:
1.	Main - The stable production branch that should always be in a deployable state
2.	Develop - Integration branch where features and bug fixes are merged
3.	Release.* - Prepares code for production deployment, allowing final testing and bug fixes
4.	Hotfix.* - Used for critical fixes in the production environment
5.	Hotfix/ecr/* - Used specifically for Emergency Change Request critical fixes in production
Non-Protected Branches:
1.	Feature.* - Used for developing new features or enhancements
2.	Bugfix.* - Used for addressing bugs found in the development phase
Branch Naming Conventions
•	Release track: release/<rel version> (e.g., release/1.6.0)
•	Hotfix track: hotfix/<rel version> (e.g., hotfix/1.6.1)
•	ECR track: hotfix/ecr/<version> (e.g., hotfix/ecr/1.6.1)
•	Feature track: feature/ADO-xxxxxxx (e.g., feature/ADO-2297575)
•	Bugfix track: bugfix/ADO-xxxxxxx (e.g., bugfix/ADO-2297575)

How branching works in Azure DevOps (ADO)

The types of branches used in SCB

Naming conventions for consistent and organized code management

🌳 Branching Overview

Branching helps developers work on different tasks — such as features, fixes, or releases — without affecting the main production code.

In SCB, branches are classified into Protected and Non-Protected types.

🔒 Protected Branches

These are the core branches of the repository.
They are locked down to prevent direct changes and ensure code stability.

Branch	Purpose
main	Stable production branch — always in a deployable state
develop	Integration branch where all features and bug fixes are merged before release
release/*	Used to prepare code for production deployment, final testing, and bug fixes
hotfix/*	Used for critical fixes directly in production
hotfix/ecr/*	Specifically for Emergency Change Request (ECR) fixes in production
🧩 Non-Protected Branches

These branches are used for active development and can be created freely by developers.

Branch	Purpose
feature/*	For developing new features or enhancements
bugfix/*	For fixing bugs identified during the development phase
🏷️ Branch Naming Conventions

To maintain clarity and traceability, follow standard branch naming formats.

Type	Format	Example
Release track	release/<rel version>	release/1.6.0
Hotfix track	hotfix/<rel version>	hotfix/1.6.1
ECR track	hotfix/ecr/<version>	hotfix/ecr/1.6.1
Feature track	feature/ADO-<work-item-id>	feature/ADO-2297575
Bugfix track	bugfix/ADO-<work-item-id>	bugfix/ADO-2297575
🧠 Quick Recap

Protected branches are stable and controlled.

Non-protected branches are for active development.

Consistent naming helps track work items in Azure DevOps.

🎬 Suggested Voiceover (Simple Script)

“In SCB’s Azure DevOps setup, branches are organized to keep the codebase clean and reliable.
Protected branches like main, develop, and release ensure production stability.
Non-protected branches like feature and bugfix are where developers work daily.
Naming conventions such as feature/ADO-12345 help link code changes back to Azure DevOps work items.
This structure ensures smooth collaboration and efficient release management.”
