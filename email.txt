“In this video, we’ll see how to create a Pull Request from a feature branch to the develop branch in Azure DevOps.”

“Before raising the PR, make sure your commits are clean and make any required updates to the azure_pipeline.yml file.”

“Next, go to Repos → Pull Requests → New Pull Request. Select your feature branch as the source, develop as the target, add a clear title and description, and assign reviewers.”

“Once the PR is created, Azure DevOps automatically runs validation checks — including the CI build defined through azure_pipeline.yml, code quality checks, security scans, and work-item linking.”

“A mandatory App Dev Lead reviewer must approve the PR. Only after all checks pass and reviews are completed can the PR be merged.”

“Finally, click Set Auto-Complete or Complete to merge the feature branch into develop.”

“All protected branches follow this PR process, ensuring code quality, traceability, and compliance with GitFlow standards.”
