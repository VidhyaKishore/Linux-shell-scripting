🔐 1. Vault
Definition: The central service for managing secrets.

In HCV: Vault is the core application that provides the interface and engine for storing, accessing, and managing sensitive data securely.

🔑 2. Secrets
Definition: Sensitive data managed by Vault.

In HCV: These can be credentials, API keys, tokens, certificates, or even dynamic secrets like short-lived AWS credentials or database logins. Vault stores and manages these securely.

🛡 3. Policies
Definition: Rules that define who can access what in Vault.

In HCV: Policies control access by mapping users or machines to specific permissions (e.g., read/write access to a secret path). They help implement least privilege access.

🔐 4. Auth Methods
Definition: Ways to authenticate to Vault.

In HCV: Vault supports multiple auth methods such as:

AppRole (used in automation)

LDAP, GitHub, Okta (for human users)

Kubernetes, AWS IAM, etc.
These determine who you are before allowing access.

⚙️ 5. Secret Engines
Definition: Plugins for storing or generating secrets.

In HCV: Each secret engine handles a specific type of secret, such as:

kv for static key-value storage

database for dynamic DB credentials

aws for generating temporary AWS keys

transit for encryption-as-a-service

🧩 Summary
In HashiCorp Vault, these five core concepts work together to provide a secure, flexible, and scalable secrets management system. Understanding these building blocks helps in securely managing secrets across various systems and environments.



-------------------------------------
🔥 Problems Without Vault
1. ❌ Secrets Hardcoded in Code
Secrets like DB passwords, API keys, tokens are often stored directly in source code.

Risk: If the code is leaked or pushed to GitHub (even privately), the secrets are exposed.

🧨 Real-world breach: Many GitHub leaks have happened due to secrets hardcoded in repos.

2. 🗂️ Secrets Stored in Plaintext Files (.env, config.json)
These files can be accidentally shared or left on a developer's machine.

Risk: Easy target for malware or internal misuse.

3. 🔄 No Secret Rotation
Passwords/keys remain the same for months or years.

Risk: Once leaked, attackers can access services indefinitely.

⚠️ Vault supports automated secret rotation – manual rotation is often forgotten.

4. 🔓 Over-permissioned Access
Without proper access control, all apps or users may access all secrets.

Risk: Lateral movement in case of a breach.

Vault uses policies to define exactly who can access what.

5. 🕵️ No Audit Trail
No logs to show who accessed a secret and when.

Risk: Impossible to detect or trace breaches.

Vault logs every read/write operation if audit logging is enabled.

6. 🛑 Can't Revoke Access Quickly
If a secret is compromised, it's hard to revoke it without restarting services or changing configs manually.

Vault allows immediate revocation of tokens and secrets.

7. ⚠️ No Encryption-as-a-Service
If you want to encrypt some data manually, you need to implement your own encryption logic.

Risk: Developers may use weak algorithms or misuse encryption libraries.

Vault can encrypt/decrypt without your app managing keys.
