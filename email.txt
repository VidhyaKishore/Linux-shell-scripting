Hi,

You're receiving this message due to a minor issue that occurred in Saba. As per the standard process, the registration and approval window closes 7 days before the session, after which invites are sent out. At that point, participants who have not been approved are automatically dropped from the system.

However, due to a glitch, this automatic removal did not happen, which caused a delay in sending the invites. Some of you have reached out to me regarding the session invite â€” please refer to the email trail for the details.

Kindly ensure you are ready with the required prerequisites before the session.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
