Intro
"In this video, we will learn how to commit your changes and push them to an Azure DevOps Git repository. Let’s begin."

Step 1: Check Your Changes
"First, let’s check what files have been modified in our working directory.
Run:*
git status
Any modified files will be shown in red. These files are not yet staged for commit."

Step 2: Stage the Files
"Before committing, we need to stage the changes.
You can stage a specific file:*
git add filename
Or stage everything at once:
git add .
After staging, run git status again — now the files will appear in green, which means they are ready for commit."

Step 3: Commit the Changes
"Next, we create a commit, which is like saving a snapshot of your work with a message that explains what you changed.
Run:*
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
Use a clear message like ‘Updated API config’ or ‘Refactored login module’."

Step 4: Push to Azure DevOps
"Now we push the committed changes to your Azure DevOps repository.
Use:*
git push
If this is your first time pushing a new branch to ADO, Git may ask to set the upstream. It will show a command like:
git push --set-upstream origin feature/my-feature
Run that once. Next time, just git push is enough."

Step 5: Sign-in or Provide Credentials (if required)
*"If you haven't configured authentication already, Azure DevOps will prompt you for credentials.
Enter your ADO username and your Personal Access Token (PAT) as the password.
If you're using Git Credential Manager, it may open a login window — just sign in with your ADO account."*

Step 6: Verify in Azure DevOps
"Once the push is complete, open your Azure DevOps project → Repos → Files.
You will see your updated files and commit history.
This confirms that your code is successfully pushed to ADO and available for your team."

Outro
"That's it! You’ve learned how to stage, commit, and push code to Azure DevOps using Git. These steps are essential for everyday development workflows.
Thank you for watching, and stay tuned for the next topic!"
