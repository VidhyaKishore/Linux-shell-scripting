Dear [Apprentice's Name],

I hope you are recovering well.

It has come to our attention that you left for your hometown (Vijayawada) around July 22 due to illness. However, this was not communicated to either the class leads or the trainer, which is a clear deviation from the expectations set at the beginning of the apprenticeship.

Additionally, you were absent again today (August 7) without any prior notice or update. Such uninformed absences not only affect your progress but also disrupt the flow of the training program.

We have also noted the following pending actions from your end:

No Azure Repos branch has been created

No work item has been created in Azure Boards

Assignments remain incomplete

As your lead, I must remind you that apprentices are expected to be present in Chennai throughout the course period unless officially approved otherwise. Any absence must be communicated and approved in advance.

You are required to respond to this email by end of day today (August 7), providing:

A clear update on your current location and availability

The reason for your continued absence

Your plan to complete the pending deliverables and rejoin the sessions

Failure to respond or continued non-compliance will be escalated to the program coordinator for further action.

Looking forward to your immediate response.
