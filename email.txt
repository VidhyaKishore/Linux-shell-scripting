Throughout the year, I have contributed significantly to strengthening engineering capability across the organisation. I delivered 72 ILT sessions with high learner satisfaction and trained over 1900 participants across Campus, Apprenticeship, JTP, and DEP programs. I introduced new courses such as Linux Shell Scripting and HashiCorp Vault, refreshed the Azure Foundation content, and collaborated with SMEs to design impactful learning experiences.

I managed ADO repos and user access for multiple cohorts, supported assessments and engagement activities, and hosted 10+ TechTalks to drive knowledge sharing. I also contributed to the ADO digital course and delivered a high-quality HashiCorp Vault masterclass in Malaysia. Additionally, I improved learning pathways, identified skill gaps, and ensured high standards in both ILT and digital learning initiatives.

Overall, I consistently supported organisational growth, enhanced learning quality, and demonstrated strong collaboration across programs and teams.
