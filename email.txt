Hi,

You're receiving this message due to a minor issue that occurred in Saba. As per the standard process, the registration and approval window closes 7 days before the session, after which invites are sent out. At that point, participants who have not been approved are automatically dropped from the system.

However, due to a glitch, this automatic removal did not happen, which caused a delay in sending the invites. Some of you have reached out to me regarding the session invite — please refer to the email trail for the details.

Kindly ensure you are ready with the required prerequisites before the session.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.


I’ve been coming to the office on Fridays along with the rest of the team. Now that we have our exclusive academy space back, I’m planning to add a second in-office day during the week. I’ll coordinate and keep you updated in the WhatsApp group once it’s finalized.
