Hello everyone!
In this session, I’m going to show you how to configure Git with your username and email ID.
These settings are very important because Git uses them to record who makes changes in a project.
Without this information, your commits will not have proper ownership.
	Open your git bash.
	Now, let’s configure the username. 
Type the following command - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	Next, we need to configure the email address.
Type the following command - git config --global user.email your-email@example.com
	To make sure Git saved your details, run: git config --list
You’ll see your username and email listed in the output.
	By default, we used the --global option.
This means your username and email are applied to all repositories on your system.
If you want different credentials for a specific project only, you can remove --global and run the same commands inside that project folder.

So in this video, we learned how to 
1.	Configured global username and email.
2.	Verified the settings.
3.	Learned the difference between global and local configurations.
