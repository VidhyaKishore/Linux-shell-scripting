What is a Computer Network?
- A computer network is a group of devices connected together so they can share data, resources, and services.
- A computer network allows computers and devices to communicate with each other.

What is IP address?
- An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to every device on a network so it can send and receive data.
- An IP address is the digital address of a device on a network.

Types of IP Addresses
- IPV4
- IPV6

IPv4 (Most Common)
32-bit address
Written in numbers
Limited addresses
eg: 192.168.1.10

IPv6 (New Generation)
128-bit address
Written in hex
Huge address space
eg: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

IPV4 Address Format
-------------------
X.X.X.X

4 numbers (called octets)
Each number ranges from 0 to 255
Separated by dots (.)
eg: 192.168.1.10

🔹 Why 0–255?
Each octet is 8 bits (1 byte)
8 bits = 2⁸ = 256 values (0–255)

IPV6 Address Format
-------------------
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx

8 groups
Each group has 4 hexadecimal characters
Uses numbers 0–9 and letters a–f
Separated by colons (:)
Eg: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

🔹 Shortened IPv6 Format

Leading zeros can be removed
Consecutive zeros can be replaced by ::
Eg: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334

Classification of IP Address
----------------------------
1. Classful Addressing (Old Method)

In classful addressing, IP addresses are divided into fixed classes based on the first octet.
(Class A,B,C,D)

🔹 Limitations
❌ Wastes IP addresses
❌ No flexibility
👉 Not used today

2. Classless Addressing (Modern Method – CIDR)

In classless addressing, networks are defined using a subnet mask, not fixed classes.

IP_address / subnet_bits
192.168.1.10/26

Network size is flexible
Better IP utilization

🔹 Why Classless?
✔ Efficient
✔ Flexible
✔ Used in modern networks and cloud

3. Public IP Address

Globally unique
Accessible on the Internet
Assigned by ISP

8.8.8.8

Used by:
Websites
Cloud servers
Internet-facing apps

4. Private IP Address
🔹 What is a Private IP?
Used inside internal networks
Not routable on the Internet
Can be reused across organizations

| Range                         |
| ----------------------------- |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 |

Used in:

Home networks
Offices
Bank internal networks

5️⃣ Static IP Address
🔹 What is Static IP?

Fixed IP
Does not change
Manually assigned or reserved

🔹 Used for:
✔ Servers
✔ Routers
✔ Firewalls
eg: Bank web server IP

6️⃣ Dynamic IP Address
🔹 What is Dynamic IP?

Automatically assigned
Changes over time
Given by DHCP

🔹 Used for:

✔ Laptops
✔ Mobiles
✔ Home users
eg: Office employee system

Subnetting?
----------
Subnetting is the process of dividing one large network into multiple smaller networks (subnets).

Why Do We Need Subnetting?

✔ Better network performance
✔ Improved security
✔ Efficient use of IP addresses
✔ Easier management and troubleshooting

Real-Life Analogy
🏢 Office Building Analogy
One big office building → One large network
Different floors/departments → Subnets

Each department has its own IP range.

How Subnetting Works (Conceptual)?
An IP address has two parts:
Network part
Host part

What are Nodes in a Network?
A node is any device connected to a network that can send, receive, or forward data.

Examples of Nodes

✔ Computer / Laptop
✔ Mobile phone
✔ Server
✔ Printer
✔ Router

What is Routing?

Routing is the process of choosing the best path and forwarding data packets from one network to another network.

What is Switching?
Switching is the process of forwarding data between devices within the same network.

Who Does Switching?
🔌 Network Switch
Operates inside a LAN
Works using MAC addresses
Connects multiple devices

Office Floor Analogy
One office floor → One network
Rooms → Devices
Switch → Reception desk
The reception desk knows which room to send the document to.

What is a Port?
A port is a logical communication endpoint on a device that identifies which application or service should receive the data.

OSI Model - Open System Interconnection
---------------------------------------
What is the OSI Model?
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a 7-layer framework that explains how data moves from one computer to another over a network.

7️⃣ Application Layer
What user interacts with
Provides network services

Examples:
HTTP, HTTPS
FTP
SMTP, DNS
📌 “User talks to the network”

6️⃣ Presentation Layer
Data formatting
Encryption / decryption
Compression

Examples:
SSL / TLS
Encryption formats
📌 “Data is prepared”

5️⃣ Session Layer
Manages sessions
Opens, maintains, closes connections

Example:
Login sessions
📌 “Conversation control”

4️⃣ Transport Layer
End-to-end communication
Port numbers
Reliability

Examples:
TCP (reliable)
UDP (fast)
📌 “Ensures data delivery”

3️⃣ Network Layer
Logical addressing
Routing between networks

Examples:
IP
Routers
📌 “Finds the path”

2️⃣ Data Link Layer
Physical addressing
Switching
Error detection

Examples:
MAC address
Switches
📌 “Delivers data inside LAN”

1️⃣ Physical Layer
Actual data transmission
Cables, signals, bits

Examples:
Ethernet cable
Fiber
Wi-Fi signals
📌 “Moves bits on wire”

User → App → Encrypt → Session → Port → IP → MAC → Cable

What is a VPN?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel over the Internet to connect users or networks as if they were on the same private network.

Why Do We Need a VPN?

✔ Secure access over Internet
✔ Data encryption
✔ Remote access to office/bank network
✔ Privacy & protection on public Wi-Fi

Real-Life Analogy (Very Effective)
📦 Courier Tunnel Analogy
Internet → Public road
VPN → Locked tunnel
Data → Sealed package
Even if someone sees the tunnel, they cannot read the data inside.

What is NAT?
NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique that converts private IP addresses into public IP addresses (and back) so devices in a private network can access the Internet.

Why Do We Need NAT?

✔ Saves public IP addresses
✔ Hides internal network structure (basic security)
✔ Enables many devices to share one public IP

What is a Network Firewall?
A network firewall is a security device or software that monitors, allows, or blocks network traffic based on pre-defined security rules.

Why Do We Need a Firewall?

✔ Prevent unauthorized access
✔ Protect internal network
✔ Control which applications/ports can communicate
✔ Essential for banks, enterprises, and cloud networks

What is a Gateway?
A gateway is a network point (device or software) that connects one network to another, often using different protocols or addressing schemes.

Why Do We Need a Gateway?

✔ To reach outside networks
✔ To access the Internet
✔ To connect different types of networks
✔ To control and route traffic out of a LAN

What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is like the Internet’s phonebook — it translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses so computers can communicate.

Why Do We Need DNS?

✔ Humans can’t remember numeric IPs easily
✔ Makes web browsing simple
✔ Supports email, websites, cloud services
